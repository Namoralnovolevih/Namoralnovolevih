# Hi, my name is Dmitriy!
___
Iâ€™m a junior Python developer. I recently completed training courses at [Hexlet](https://en.hexlet.io/) and continue to grow in the field of programming.  

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m learning Python, Django, and databases. Iâ€™m open to new projects and eager to apply my knowledge in practice.  

ðŸš€ My journey is just beginning, but Iâ€™m ready for exciting challenges!
